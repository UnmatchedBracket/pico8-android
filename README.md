# PICO-8 for Android
*todo: write a proper readme*

## whats this stuff
- `frontend/`: Godot app part; sets up environment and handles video output and keyboard/mouse input.
- `bootstrap/` (in git soon): Enviroment for running PICO-8, including scripts, proot, and a minimal rootfs.
- `shim/` (in git soon): Library LD_PRELOAD'ed into PICO-8 to handle streaming i/o and making sure SDL acts exactly as needed.

## Building
### Godot Frontend
1. Download [Godot](https://godotengine.org) version â‰¥4.4.1.
2. Put `package.dat` from Releases in the project ~~or build it from bootstrap/ (soon)~~; this is the bootstrap package and is pretty essential
3. In Godot, **Project > Install Android Build Template**
4. then just do the normal **Project > Export**
